# pomodoroTimer
A pomodoro timer to play around with flexbox.

Up and running here: http://codepen.io/BenjaminDowns/full/MKdONK/

## Lessons learned: 
1. Flexbox is great for individual componenets, and a disaster for overall layout.
2. Angular has some nice wrappers for vanilla JS methods like setInterval, clearInterval; and the data-binding makes model<-->view relationship simple to manage (especially with this slightly overburdened UI) but vanilla JS could have easily handled this kind of basic app.
